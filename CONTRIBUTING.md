## Issues & Pull Requests 

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue for `features`/`bugs`/`docs` please follow these steps:

1. search existing issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
1. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example `bug` or `feature` or `doc`)
1. comment on the Issue asking for it to be assigned to you (do not tag maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
1. **only** start working on this issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used.

### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

1. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you (do not tag any maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
1. after the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
1. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #85`)

> Notes:
> - only request to be assigned an issue if you know how to work on it
